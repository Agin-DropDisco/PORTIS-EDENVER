- [x] Polkastarter is thrilled to announce that we are partnering with Moonbeam, an Ethereum compatible parachain that allows for easy integration between the Ethereum and Polkadot ecosystems


[Moonbeam‚Äôs](https://moonbeam.network/) technology offers us an efficient way to re-deploy our current Solidity code to Polkadot with limited changes needed. This is a key advantage of Moonbeam as it cuts down the developer time and resources required to make such a migration. Moonbeam is able to transpile Solidity and other Ethereum-native logic & code to be compatible with Substrate and Web3 environments on Polkadot.


 Polkastarter is a protocol for cross-chain token sales and swaps. One of the main use cases is to be able to facilitate transfers between the two main smart contracting platforms: Ethereum and Polkadot. This partnership was forged because Moonbeam gives our Solidity developers a framework for quickly and efficiently porting existing Ethereum facing code to the Polkadot Ecosystem. Such technologies prevent us from having to reinvent the wheel again, and to be able to use popular and robust developer tools like Truffle and other code suites for Polkadot development.


> ‚ÄúWe are very excited to be working with Moonbeam in this partnership. The technology that Moonbeam provides will save us time and effort, in order to bring better products to our users, faster. This is an important step towards making truly autonomous and decentralized cross-chain swaps and token sales a reality.‚Äù ‚Äî Daniel Stockhaus, CEO of Polkastarter.

## Polkadot


Polkadot is a multi-chain platform where individual use-case blockchains are all coordinated and processed in parallel, while all sharing the security of the central relay chain. This gives Polkadot a scaling advantage over general use blockchains like Ethereum that have to process all transactions in series. These multiple types of blockchains on Polkadot (called ‚Äúparachains‚Äù) can all have different functions and use-cases, and Moonbeam is one of them specifically designed to run Ethereum‚Äôs EVM and smart contracts natively.


## Polkastarter ü§ù Moonbeam


 By utilising Moonbeam, Polkastarter‚Äôs Ethereum facing logic and smart contracts can be easily ported over to the Polkadot Network. This will allow us to save a lot of time and developer resources. Our applications for token swaps, sales and DEXs will be able to perform cross-chain transactions and functions more efficiently and in a more user friendly way. By ultimately leveraging the Moonbeam tech stack, this will allow Polkastarter to facilitate cross-chain swaps and token fundraising using both Ethereum and Polkadot based value assets.


> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve already seen exceptional growth in the DeFi space since Polkadot‚Äôs MainNet launch. We‚Äôre excited to continue that growth by partnering with the Polkastarter team to bring their DEX into the ecosystem. Their platform will give projects an easier path to token exchange and raising capital in a decentralized fashion.‚Äù said Nate Hamilton, Head of Business Development for Moonbeam at PureStake.


## About Moonbeam


Moonbeam is an Ethereum-compatible smart contract platform on the Polkadot network that makes it easy to build natively interoperable applications. This Ethereum compatibility allows developers to deploy existing Solidity smart contracts and DApp frontends to Moonbeam with minimal changes. As a parachain on the Polkadot network, Moonbeam will benefit from the shared security of the Polkadot relay chain and integrations with other chains that are connected to Polkadot. Currently, in active development by PureStake, Moonbeam is expected to reach MainNet by early 2021. Learn more: https://moonbeam.network/


## About Polkastarter


[Polkastarter](https://www.polkastarter.com/) is a permissionless DEX built for cross-chain token pools and auctions, enabling projects to raise capital on a decentralized and interoperable environment based on Polkadot. With Polkastarter, decentralized projects will be able to raise and exchange capital cheap and fast. Users will be able to participate in a secure and compliant environment and to use assets that go way beyond the current ERC20 standard.
